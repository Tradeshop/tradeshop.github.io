									<h2>About this</h2>
									<p>This page contains the links to the test builds of the plugin. They are intended for official testers, so if you are not one and ended up on this page, it was most likely involuntary. Builds are uploaded here whenever a new release of the TradeShop plugin is currently being worked on.</p>
									<hr />

									<h2>Warning</h2>
									<p>These usually have the -TEST version tag, which warns the user of the build's possibly buggy and/or instable nature. It is important to keep in mind, that these builds can be patched quickly and reuploaded, and that between these patches the version tag is likely to remain the same. For this reason, the version tag should <strong>not</strong> be used to identify a test build.</p>
									<p>It can not be stressed enough, that these builds are <strong>not intended</strong> for use in production. Please only use certified -STABLE or -BETA releases, which were downloaded from the <a href="">official download page on SpigotMC</a> if you plan on making the server available to the public. Lastly, if you have important data on the server where you are running these builds (worlds, configurations, userdata...) <strong>please take backups</strong> before installing a test build.</p>
